# Generative Adversarial Network with TensorFlow and Python

This project demonstrates how to build a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow and Python. GANs are a class of neural networks designed for unsupervised learning, where two networks—the generator and the discriminator—compete against each other to produce data indistinguishable from real data.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a GAN that can generate images similar to those in a given dataset. The generator network learns to produce realistic images, while the discriminator network learns to distinguish between real and generated images. Through this adversarial process, both networks improve over time.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
